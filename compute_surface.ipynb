It has large, narrow ', 'wheels, a slim frame and curved, ', 'drop handlebars. Pedals with ', 'treads, clips and straps allow ', 'you to really step on it! Whizz… ', 'and you’re gone. ', 'MOUNTAIN BIKE This heavier, ', 'bulkier bike looks altogether ', 'more rugged. Its deep tyre ', 'treads allow it to cope with ', 'uneven terrain. It won’t let ', 'you down on woodland ', 'tracks, and stones and mud ', 'are like child’s play… This all-', 'terrain bike is quite at home ', 'on roads too. ', 'TANDEM This bike is a dream!

', 'What isn’t so good is the ', 'greater weight. If the battery ', 'runs out, you may have ', 'a problem on your hands. ', 'FOLDING BIKE A bike the size ', 'of a suitcase.

Over time, I may come to accept a  new cat or dog friend, but it usually takes me a while. After all,  I must make sure that my human pack still loves me since our  house is so crowded all of a sudden!  \\nEach one of us is unique. That's because we are not  usually bred, and unlike other breeds don’t have to meet  strict rules on personality and temperament. We tend to  be smart (naturally), playful, and full of energy, but not  crazy hotheads. An afternoon snooze on a window sill?  Yes, please. What we really love, though, is hunting — our \\n hunting instincts are very strong. \\n1. Chinese Li Hua 2. Australian Mist 3. Desert Lynx Cat  4. American Shorthair  5. Mojave Spotted Cat 6. Highlander Shorthair The first humans I ever befriended were  the Roman soldiers I accompanied on  their journey around Europe, protecting  their food supplies from hungry rodents  and cheeky birds. I can't even describe  the respect they showed me! Over time,  I stopped being a wild predator and  turned into a loyal domestic companion,  as well as the terror of all mice that  infest pantries and storerooms. \""
